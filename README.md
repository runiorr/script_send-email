# script_send-email
Edit the "message.txt" with the message you want, then edit the "mycontacts.txt" with your contacts name and email.
Create a "my_infos.py" file and save two variables. "login" and "password" of your email account. You'll need to change the host and port as well.
The program will iterate the contacts file and send an email to each one contaning the message you wrote.
